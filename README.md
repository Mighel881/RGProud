RGProud is a tweak designed for those who appreciate both security and aesthetics. Like A LightTraffic Without The Yellow, this tweak will color the "proud lock" red when the device is unauthenticated and green when authenticated. Furthermore, RGProud offers the flexibility to reposition the proud lock wherever you prefer on your device's screen.

## Features
